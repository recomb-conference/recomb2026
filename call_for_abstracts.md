## Posters

{{ site.title }} invites the submission of abstracts for the poster track. Posters can also be simultaneously submitted for display at one of the satellite meetings' poster sessions. Posters accepted to both RECOMB and one of the satellite meetings are welcome to be displayed at both meetings.

Please submit a 250-word abstract of your poster that describes its primary results. Your submission should also include the author(s), their affiliations, the presenting author, the e-mail address of at least the contact author and the poster title as requested by the submission system. The abstract should be plain text and should not contain any figures.

Submission details will be announced soon.
